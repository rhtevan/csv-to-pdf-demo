= CSV to PDF Demo - Fuse 7.6SB2 (Camel 2)

This demo code is developed by using the 'REST API Level 0 - Fuse Booster' project as the fundation which shows how to map business operations to a remote procedure call endpoint over HTTP by using a REST framework. It corresponds to Level 0 in the Richardson Maturity Model. 

This demo will start with generating CSV file which contains 30 random business records per file in every 2 minutes, followed by grouping those records by their correspondent business entity, and then complete the pdf form provided by Service Canada, link:https://catalogue.servicecanada.gc.ca/content/EForms/en/CallForm.html?Lang=en&PDF=SC-NAS5050.pdf[SC-NAS5050]. At the end of the process, pdf files can be upload to designated ftp site. 

This demo showcases the OOTB (Out-Of-The-Box) support for EIPs (Enterprise Integration Pattern), such as Aggregator and Splitter, by Red Hat Fuse as well as other capabilities like CSV file processing and PDF generation.  

By using this Fuse booster, you can quickly prototype and flexibly design a REST API.

This booster introduces the mechanics of interacting with a remote (exposed by Apache Camel) service using the HTTP protocol. 

Use this booster to:

* Execute an HTTP GET request on the `camel/greetings/{name}` endpoint by using the URL parameter `{name}`. The JSON-formatted response has a payload of `Hello, $name!` (where `$name` is replaced by the value of the URL parameter from the HTTP GET request).

* Browse the API's Swagger page.
                
== Deployment options

You can run this booster in the following modes:

* Standalone on your machine
* Single-node OpenShift cluster
* OpenShift Online at link:{launchURL}[]

The most effective way to use this booster is to deploy and run the project on OpenShift.

For more details about running this booster on a single-node OpenShift cluster, CI/CD deployments, as well as the rest of the runtime, see the link:http://appdev.openshift.io/docs/spring-boot-runtime.html[Spring Boot Runtime Guide].

IMPORTANT: This booster requires Java 8 JDK (Tested with OpenJDK 11) or later and Maven 3.3.x or later.

== Running the booster standalone on your machine

To run this booster as a standalone project on your local machine:

. Download the project and extract the archive on your local filesystem.

. Build the project:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ cd PROJECT_DIR
$ mvn clean package
----
. Run the services:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ mvn spring-boot:run
----
. By default, the generated files can be found at 'target/doc' (Use 'Ctrl-C' to exist)
. (Optional) Go to link:http://localhost:8080[] and then follow the instructions on that page.


== Running the booster on a single-node OpenShift cluster

A single-node OpenShift cluster provides you with access to a cloud environment that is similar to a production environment.

If you have a single-node OpenShift cluster, such as Minishift or the Red Hat Container Development Kit, link:http://appdev.openshift.io/docs/minishift-installation.html[installed and running], you can deploy your booster there.

To deploy this booster to a running single-node OpenShift cluster:

. Download the project and extract the archive on your local filesystem.

. Log in to your OpenShift cluster:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc login -u developer -p developer
----

. Create a new OpenShift project for the booster:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc new-project MY_PROJECT_NAME
----

. Change the directory to the folder that contains the extracted booster application (for example, `my_openshift/fuse-rest-http-booster`) :
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ cd my_openshift/fuse-rest-http-booster
----

. Build and deploy the project to the OpenShift cluster:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ mvn clean -DskipTests fabric8:deploy -Popenshift
----

. In your browser, navigate to the `MY_PROJECT_NAME` project in the OpenShift console.
Wait until you can see that the pod for the `fuse-rest-http-booster` application has started up.

. On the project's `Overview` page, locate the URL for the `fuse-rest-http-booster` application. The URL uses this form:
`http://fuse-rest-http-booster-MY_PROJECT_NAME.OPENSHIFT_IP_ADDR.nip.io`.

. Click the URL to access the Greeting Service and then follow the instructions on that page.

=== Running the booster on a single-node OpenShift cluster without preinstalled images
To deploy your booster to a running single-node OpenShift cluster without preinstalled images:

. Download the project and extract the archive on your local filesystem.

. Log in to your OpenShift cluster:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc login -u developer -p developer
----

. Create a new OpenShift project for the booster:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc new-project MY_PROJECT_NAME
----

. Import base images in your newly created project (MY_PROJECT_NAME):
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc import-image {image-name-version} --from={image-registry}{image-prefix}{image-name-version} --confirm
----

. Build and deploy the project to the OpenShift cluster:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ mvn clean -DskipTests fabric8:deploy -Popenshift -Dfabric8.generator.fromMode=istag -Dfabric8.generator.from=MY_PROJECT_NAME/{image-name-version}
----

. In your browser, navigate to the `MY_PROJECT_NAME` project in the OpenShift console.
Wait until you can see that the pod for the `fuse-rest-http-booster` application has started up.

. On the project's `Overview` page, locate the URL for the `fuse-rest-http-booster` application. The URL uses this form:
`http://fuse-rest-http-booster-MY_PROJECT_NAME.OPENSHIFT_IP_ADDR.nip.io`.

. Click the URL to access the greetings service application and then follow the instructions on that page.

== Running the booster on OpenShift Online

To deploy this booster directly to OpenShift Online when you create the project at link:{launchURL}[].

. Go to link:{launchURL}[].
. At the *Deployment step*, select *Use OpenShift Online*.
. Follow the on-screen instructions to create a new *REST API Level 0* project by using the *Fuse* runtime.

NOTE: As part of the process of creating this booster, link:{launchURL}[] sets up a project with a CI/CD deployment of this booster. You can see the status of this deployment in your single-node OpenShift cluster or OpenShift Online web console.
